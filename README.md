# **SQL Data Cleaning and Exploratory Data Analysis**

## üìå **Overview**

This project focuses on **cleaning and exploring** a dataset related to layoffs from **March 2020 to March 2023**. The dataset includes information on various companies, their locations, industries, the number of employees laid off, the percentage of workforce reduction, layoff dates, company stages, countries, and funds raised.

The goal is to **create a table in MySQL**, clean the data to address missing values and inconsistencies, and conduct an **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** to uncover insights into global layoffs.

**üí° Dataset and project files are available in this repository.**
